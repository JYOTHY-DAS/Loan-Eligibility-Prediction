# Loan Eligibility Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the **Loan Eligibility Prediction** project, which was developed as part of an **Analytics Vidhya hackathon**. The objective of the project is to predict loan eligibility based on applicant details using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various attributes related to loan applicants, such as:
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Term
- Credit History
- Marital Status
- Education Level
- Property Area
- Dependents
- Self-Employment Status

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature engineering
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding feature distributions
   - Identifying correlations
   
3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Tried multiple machine learning models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forest
     - XGBoost
   - Evaluated models using accuracy and other relevant metrics
   
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Optimized the best model using Grid Search / Randomized Search
   
5. **Model Evaluation & Submission**
   - Final model performance tested on validation data
   - Predictions submitted to Analytics Vidhya

## Results
The final score obtained in the **Analytics Vidhya hackathon** is documented in `results.txt`.

## Requirements
To run the project, install the necessary dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Loan_Eligibility_Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Loan_Eligibility_Prediction
   ```
3. Run the notebook in `notebooks/` to explore the dataset and train models.
4. Execute scripts in `src/` for data preprocessing and model training.
